## Architectures

The Grid System is meant to be simple and easy to use. To goal is to obtain way to build light, flexible and reusable way to build layouts.

### Styles

Some styles are needed to make it work properly :

* [`o-grid.scss`](../assets/styles/objects/_grid.scss): Objecy file where the default grid styles are set. Column numbers, modifiers, options.
* [`u-grid-columns.scss`](../assets/styles/utilities/_grid-column.scss): Utility file where it generates every possible column styles based on an array of media queries and column numbers.

### Build tasks

The generation of columns adds a lot of styles in the css output file. To solve that, a build task is set up to purge unused css generated by [`u-grid-columns.scss`](../assets/styles/utilities/_grid-column.scss) using [PurgeCSS].

#### Config file

Depending on your project, you will need to specify all the files that will include the Grid System classes. These files will be parsed by [PurgeCSS] and then a "cleaned" css file will be generated. The styles should also compile everytime the following listed files are changed.

```json
// Charcoal project example
"purgeCSS": {
    "content": [
        "./www/**/*.html", 
        "./views/app/template/**/*.mustache",
        "./src/App/Template/*.php",
        "./assets/scripts/**/*" // use case: el.classList.add('u-gc-1/2')
    ]
}
```
